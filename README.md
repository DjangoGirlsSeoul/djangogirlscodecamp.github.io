<h1>Django Girls Site</h1>

<p>This site is about the Django Girls Seoul community. We created it to gather and provide information in one 
place about our happenings, our organization, our organizers, and coaches. It also has all of our curriculum 
so those that are unable to attend the meetings can follow along at home.
We have a portfolio's section to show off the awesome projects that our participants made over the winter code camp 2016.
We recently added a sponsors section(thank you!). And all of our social media, resources and other important information can be found in the footer.</p>

<p>If you have something to add please fork away! </p>
